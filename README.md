# XXXXL_IoT-Digital-Inclinometer_RaspberryPi_WebApp

Creating a Digital Inclinometer for the Internet of Things (IoT):
- Using the sensors from a single board microcomputer with a reading time of a few milliseconds.
- Development of a real-time raw data sharing system via: TCP, UDP, WebSocket, REST interface (HTTP protocol), MQTT.
- Compare and optimize data transfer times in real time in different technologies..
- Development of a real-time data reception and processing interface for the customer. Compare processing time and introduced delays.
- Development of a web application for real-time data visualization.
- ⭐⭐Non-Touch control by Hands Gesture Detection (Hand -> open, closed, 1 finger & Left hand, Right hand & Different combinations hands )
